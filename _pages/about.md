<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am an entry level data scientist with background in biotechnology.
During my academic career, I developed and implemented new systems for the production of complex biopharmaceuticals (e.g. vaccines). During this work, I came across the need to use better tools to support the decision making while analyzing data. Thus, I invested in parallel education and fell in love with the field of data science. I have completed a post-graduation and I am now looking for a job in the area. I wish to make a full transition into data science professionally and welcome opportunities to further expand my expertise.</p>

**Data Science technical skills:** 
* Database technology, data processing technologies and data mining skills enable me to explore the concepts of data warehousing and database management systems, extraction, transformation, and loading of data (ETL), as well as the use of analytical processing techniques and data mining to support decision making. Coverage of classic machine learning topics.
* Basic know-how on cloud infrastructure (Google and Amazon) and big data processing (Spark). Regarding time series analysis, I have basic know-how in methods relevant for economic decision-making or for the monitoring and control of processes (e.g. filtering, exponential smoothing and ARIMA Models). 
* Basic use of virtualization (Docker) for scientific computational reproducibility.
* Finally, I am more fluent in Python but I have sufficient knowledge of R and SQL to interpret and do basic scripts or queries.

**Most used libraries in python**- 
* Data Analysis: Numpy, Pandas 
* Machine Learning: Imbalanced-learn; Scikit-learn, Mlxtend;
* Time series forecast: stastmodel, prophet
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn; Dashboard/ web apps: bokeh, panel(holoviz)
* Basic distributed computing: Pyspark, Dask;  
* basic interface with databases: Sqlite3, SQLAlchemy; among others.
