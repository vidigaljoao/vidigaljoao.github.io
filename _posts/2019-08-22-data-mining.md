<p style='text-align: justify;'> Data mining is the process of discovering interesting patterns from massive amounts of data.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> As a knowledge discovery process, it typically involves data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, pattern discovery, pattern evaluation, and knowledge presentation.</p>


## 1. Data Processing

<p style='text-align: justify;'>"Data have quality if they satisfy the requirements of the intended use."</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>There are some people that doesn't consider data processing as data mining. However, is essential to do a correct data mining process.</p>

**What is data processing?**

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Data processing is a collection of tasks that originate meaningful information. These tasks are:</p>

* **Data Cleaning** - "cleans" the data by filling in the missing values, smoothing noisy data. Also, identifies or removes the outliers , and resolves inconsistencies. 
* **Data integration** - is the integration of multiple sources of data.
* **Data reduction** - reduced representation of the data, much smaller in volume, yet achieving the same results. 
* **Normalization** - converts data into appropriate forms for mining.
* **Data discretization**- numeric data is transformed by mapping values to interval or concept labels.

## 2. Frequent Pattern Mining

<p style='text-align: justify;'> "Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) is one of the most important techniques because of its ability to locate the repeating relationships between different items in a data set and represent them in the form of association rules."</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> FPM algorithms are efficient and scalable algorithm used to identify the significant hidden patterns that frequently exist in data. The most important  are the Apriori algorithm and FP-Growth algorithm.</p>
 

## 3. Classification

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Classification is a form of data analysis that extracts models describing important data classes. Such models, called classifiers, predict categorical class labels.
Data classification is a two-step process, consisting of a learning step and a classification step . For that reason is called a supervised learning. Examples of classifiers are decision tree , support vector machines, among many others.</p>

## 4. Clustering

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Cluster analysis  is the process of partitioning a set of data objects (or observations) into subsets. As a data mining method, cluster analysis can be used as a standalone tool to gain
insight into the distribution of data, to observe the characteristics of each cluster, and to focus on a particular set of clusters for further analysis. Clustering is an unsupervised learning and can be used as a processing step. Some of the most known clusters methods are partitioning (like the k-means) or hierarchical (like the Agglomerative clustering).</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Identifying the hidden patterns of a data set enables users to make the appropriate decision and action especially in a critical situation.</p>
