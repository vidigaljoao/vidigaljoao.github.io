![Hello World!](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Hello_world_c.svg/800px-Hello_world_c.svg.png)

This is the first post of what will be my data science blog. Hope you like it!

## Why the blog?
<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am currently finishing my PhD in biotechnology. Yet I wish to full transition into the data science field. 
To do so I will compile and document some topics that I think are important in this journey of mine.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The name Data Driven Decisions was choose as its something I always live by. My scientific background and academic career  are mostly behind my data driven decisions. Decisions backed by hard data and scientific method. </p>

This is the role of data scientist. To be able to extract value from data and make rational business decisions in the current competitive environment.

## Website architecture

This website is based off the Minimal Mistakes theme by Michael Rose, generated with Jekyll and hosted by GitHub Pages.

There are three major sections:

*  [Homepage/Blog](/). Here I  will  post some content about Data Science.
* [Portfolio](/portfolio/). In this section I will add a collection of projects done in Data Science.
* Finally, [About](/about/) where I show some details of who I am and what I do and  my main technical skills.
