As the majority of data science projects start in a notebook, now they can also end with it.

> Panel is an open-source Python library that lets you create custom interactive web apps and dashboards by connecting user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text.

The major goal of Panel is prototyping a dashboard in the notebook and deploy it as a standalone server app. As  notebooks excel in data exploration and communication, now they are also used for  advanced interactive visualizations.  That's why Panel is a game changer. Panel enables us to build entire apps within a Jupyter notebook . 

Here are the key ideas:

* Perform some analysis and design the app inside a Jupyter notebook. 
* Test the app as a standalone web server by adding .show()
* When achived the final design/output, change the .show() to a .servable() object.
* Use Panel’s serve command to test the app locally. 

```
panel serve -show app.ipynb
```
* When everything is working locally, Heroku is a great deployment option. Using the default Python buildpack and a requirements.txt file, one can easily specify the exact Python environment for deployment.
