**Data mining** is the process of discovering interesting patterns from massive amounts of data.
As a knowledge discovery process, it typically involves data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, pattern discovery, pattern evaluation, and knowledge presentation.

A collection of projects were added to the portfolio concerning data mining methods and techniques.

The major topics adressed on those projects are:

* Data preprocessing
* Pattern mining
* Cluster Analysis
* Classification
